# React To-Do App — Task Management Web App

This is a simple To-Do list web application built using **React**, **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**.

You can **create** tasks, **delete** them, and **move them up or down** to organize your list. 

The app is lightweight, fast, and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

The UI automatically switches between **light mode** and **dark mode** based on the user’s system theme.

## How It Works

- Type a task in the input box
- Click Add to add it to the list
- Use Up or Down buttons to reorder tasks
- Click Delete to remove a task
- If there are no tasks, a message asks you to add one
- UI theme follows **system preference** (dark or light)
